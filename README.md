# R2-D2

Welcome to the R2-D2 project repository.

## Project Overview

The R2-D2 project aims to modernize the control systems of the iconic astromech droid using cutting-edge technologies, including Python and optional ROS 2 simulation. The repository includes tools for hardware abstraction, AI-assisted autonomous control, and legacy protocol emulation.

## Features

- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** Interfaces for motors, dome control, servos, LEDs, and sound.
- **AI Integration:** TensorFlow Lite for face and person detection, enabling dome movement suggestions.
- **Simulation Support:** ROS 2 and Gazebo-based simulation for testing without hardware.
- **Sequence Engine:** YAML-defined routines for timed actions like servo movements and lighting effects.
- **Legacy Protocol Support:** Emulation of MarcDuino/Shadow command protocols for backward compatibility.

## Getting Started

This repository is ready for development.
